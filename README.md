# Handwritten-Digit-and-Character-Recognition

In todayâ€™s digitized world, there is a vast amount of handwritten data that requires efficient processing and analysis. Handwritten digit and character recognition systems play a crucial role in converting handwritten text into digital format, enabling automation in various industries such as finance, postal services, and document management. This project proposal aims to develop a robust and accurate handwritten digit and character recognition system using machine learning techniques.
